<p style="font-family:Verdana; color:black">So watch my chest heave
As this last breath leaves me
I am trying to be
What you're dying to see
I feel like "fuck man,
Can't take this, anymore,
This heart, break this."
This is life that's so thankless,
How could he just forsake us?</p>

<h2 id="one">Section 1 </h2>
<p style="font-family:Verdana;">Breaks us he makes us
Hate us he gave us
Nothing but no trust
And I am so fucked up
So let this gun bond us
Let's hide by this lust
And once we are just dust
He'll know that he loved us</p>

<h2 id="two">Section Two </h2>
<p>Let it all burn
I will burn first
God I've tried, am I lost in your eyes?
Just let me burn, it's what I deserve.
God I've lied, am I lost in your eyes?
So take me and make me
Weakened and save me</p>

<h2 id="three">Section Three </h2>
<p>This hate that you gave me
Keeps saying the same thing
To sing when you hurt
And to sing when you cry
To sing when you live
And to sing when you die
And here at the end</p>


<h2 id="four"> SEction Four</h2>
<p>My nail tech knows how to keep a lil' secret
I don't wish for my success, I speak it
I caught a buzz, and you did too, but you tweakin'
I look like I been gettin' money, how I reek it
You smell me, that's LV
Walkin' 'round with my chest out, and my skin smooth, I'm healthy
I'm in the mix and I'm handshakin'
But most of y'all can't help me (Nah)
Most of y'all ain't wealthy (Nope)
Most of y'all just dress like it
I caught the vibe that y'all givin' off
And I'm tryna make myself less like it
This chick got a lil' Porsche body, I might let the bro test drive it
It's hard for me to get excited, I love music, and stress 'bout it
My city haulin' and I'm cosigning this wave, comin' up next out it
Ridin' 'round and shotgun in her Tesla
Hangin' both of my legs out of it, like "What's up?" (What's up?)
I got stakes and they too high now, I can't fuck up (Can't fuck up)
I like girls that's down to Earth, so don't be stuck up (Stuck up)
I don't take Ls, I give 'em out and I chuck 'em up
First listen they hearin' this shit, like "What the fuck?"

Ten toes, that's my MO
Fam' over gram, that's my MO (On my momma)
Fuck a close friends, I got friends that I keep close
And they let it go while I reload

Like bow, bow, bow
TSA just opened my bookbag up
And my chain hittin' like bow, bow, bow, bow
The king's back in his hometown, when them wheels hit
And I touchdown they bow, bow, bow, bow
She down low, three point stance
I'm back there doin' Jack Dan's like bow, bow, bow, bow</p>
